Ether wallet private key recovery (Ethereum)

# When is this useful?
When you've made an Ether transaction on the Ethereum network and you incorrectly typed your private key in something like https://www.myetherwallet.com, so then you've taken the generated public wallet address and sent your Ether to it, even though it doesn't relate to your real private key.

# What do I need for this to work?
The public wallet address which now contains your Ether.
The private key which you thought you typed when the incorrect public wallet address was generated.

# In which circumstances will this be able to find the private key to the wallet which contains my Ether?
1. If the private key that you actually typed is the same length as the real one
2. If you only made a single typo when entering the private key
